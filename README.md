# Pong-Unity

[**PLAY GAME**](https://shrunbr.github.io/pong-unity/)</span>

The object of the game is to get the ball to the edge behind your opponent, when you do that you score. Positions reset upon score.

**Controls:**

### Credits
This is my recreation of Pong [originally created by Allan Alcorn/Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

This is the first game I "made" in Unity as part of [The 20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/).

Thanks to [Zigurous](https://github.com/zigurous) and [Adam Graham](https://github.com/adamgraham) for the Unity tutorials!
